# JS-Dynamic-Calendar
 
A practice project to enhance JavaScript skills, this repository contains a dynamically generated calendar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calendar is generated dynamically through JavaScript code and replaces the static HTML structure. It serves as a hands-on exercise to reinforce JavaScript concepts and demonstrate proficiency in manipulating the DOM to create interactive and functional web components.
